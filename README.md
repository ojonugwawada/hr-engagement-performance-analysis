# 📊 Workforce Engagement, Performance, and Compensation in HR Data

This project explores key human resource (HR) metrics such as salary, engagement, satisfaction, tenure, and performance using advanced statistical analysis and visualization techniques. The analysis is built upon a real-world HR dataset and applies concepts of descriptive statistics, confidence intervals, and hypothesis testing.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To investigate employee performance, compensation equity, and engagement trends using statistical methods that drive workforce policy and decision-making.

## 🌱 AgriTech Context
In rural and agritech startups where talent is scarce and retention is crucial, workforce analytics provides a data-driven basis for:
- Aligning compensation with contribution
- Supporting high-performing employees
- Preventing role burnout and unfair workloads

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statistical Analysis (T-tests, ANOVA, Confidence Intervals)
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🗂️ Files Included
- `Workforce Engagement, Performance, and Compensation in HR Data.ipynb`: The full Python notebook
- `HR Analysis Report.pdf`: A complete narrative report summarizing methodology, results, and insights

## 🔍 Analysis Highlights
- 📌 **Central Tendency**: Mean salary by department, median age by performance, mode of engagement by role
- 📌 **Dispersion**: Salary, age, tenure, and project variation analysis
- 📌 **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs for salary and engagement
- 📌 **Hypothesis Testing**: T-tests and ANOVA to compare salaries, engagement, and project load

## 💡 Key Insights
- Executives earned the most; production roles the least
- Engagement didn’t significantly differ across departments
- Special projects were unequally distributed among roles

## 🤝 Contribution
This project provides actionable data for HR planning in modern organizations, especially those scaling rural or distributed teams as part of inclusive AgriTech models.
